Tests for CSVfix. These require the bash shell to run. They have only
been tested with the MSYS version of bash on Windows. To run all the
tests, use:

	runall

To run a single test, use:

	run1 testname

for example:

	run1 pad.test

The tests do not cover anywhere near all features of the CSVfix
command set, but they do (I think) give at least one test per command.
